# Writing and Running Python
You need a place to write your Python code, and a place to run it.

To start off, we will write and run our code online from the web using https://trinket.io/python. But this only works in the short term, with quick and easy programs.

When you are ready to write and run things from your computer, follow these instructions: https://www.pythonlearn.com/install.php. There are recommendations and links for downloading a text editor (to write code) and an environment in which to run your Python code.
PythonLearn recommends TextWrangler as a text editor - but Sublime is another good one, as it color codes your code for you. You can download it here: https://www.sublimetext.com/download

# Some Terminology
- a variable is information given an identifier and stored for reuse by the program (ex: x = 5 -> x is the variable)
- a conditional statement tells the program perform different actions depending on whether specified conditions evaluate to true or false
- a comment is a line of code that is not read by the computer - it exists as information for humans reading the code (for example, to explain the purpose of sections of code). In Python, a comment must start with #

# Rock Paper Scissors Game
random is a module that we are importing to use in our program, in order to generate random numbers for the computer

**raw_input()** is a function that displays information (such as a question) and then gets input from the user - you can store this input it in an assigned variable

**.lower()** is a function that turns a string into lowercase

**while** is a conditional statement that means “as long as” - as long as a certain condition evaluates to true, the computer will continue to perform the desired action

**print()** prints the contents of the parentheses to the console

**if/elif/else** is a conditional statement, which operate like branches from a tree of options, each with their own consequence depending on which branch is chosen

Once you have written and run the program, think about these questions:
- How might you make this code even better? What kind of improvements or adjustments might you want to make to this game?
- Now that you have programmed a rock, paper, scissors game, what do you think you would want to program next?
